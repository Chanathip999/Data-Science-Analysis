## Overview

My project aims to provide clear and insightful visualizations of COVID-19 data, including:

- Daily and cumulative case counts
- Death and recovery rates
- Geographic distribution of cases
- Trends over time

By transforming raw data into meaningful graphs and charts, I hope to make it easier for people to grasp the scale and spread of the virus.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Explore data with interactive charts and maps.
- **Customization**: Easily adjust parameters to focus on specific regions or time periods.
